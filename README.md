1. Language Tranlator: A simple gui which incorpriates STT and a language model to translate the language. No need to specify input language. The models are very accurate. 


2. Time Location and Stock: Incorperate function calling. Function calling in APIs involves the language model interpreting a user's natural language request and generating a JSON object that can be used to call external APIs in response to user queries. The stock program, the user can ask for the different prices of stocks, compaire the price of stocks (e.g is googles stock more expensive than teslas). The benifit of this approach can be seen. For example, the user might ask, show me paddock 1. their natural language is interpreted and a JSON output is generated which could call your API and display the paddock data etc.


3. TTS: A more human sounding TTS model.
